===========================

A fully interactive version of the [matplotlib chaotic double pendulum animation demonstration](http://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/double_pendulum_animated.html)

This modified version includes 1) sliders that can be used to interactively vary the physical parameters of the simulation during the animation and 2) a button that opens a series of plots illustrating the full dynamical evolution of the physical system.

```

Required modules:
